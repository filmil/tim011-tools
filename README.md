# tim011-tools

timdisk.sh is a BASH script that can extract, create and list TIM-011 floppy images. The script uses cpmtools package for this.

When extracting a floppy image, its contents is extracted into a directory with the following structure:
```
dirname/
dirname/1/
dirname/2/
...
```
User area 0 is extracted directly into directory, while other user areas are extracted into their own subdirectories. Same structure is used when creating floppy image from directory.

Script timdisk.sh uses the following files:
* diskdefs - definitions of SB180 floppy formats for cpmtools
* empty.img - initial empty image used for new image creation

For detailed usage, type:
```
timdisk.sh -h
```
